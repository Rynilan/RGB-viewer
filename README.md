# The idea

    Once I was teaching a friend of mine the concept of base 16 system and came in mind  
    the fact that normally RGB collors where referenced as hexadecimals (this base 16  
    system) then I had the idea of "why not to do a RGB vizualizer?", then I did.  

# How to run

    This is a simple program, just run the 'main.py' file and wait, the commands are  
    pretty straight foward:  

    * Move the scales foward or backward to add or subtract the level of that color.  
    * the button to add and substract make the level of the color change by 1.  
    * The hexadecimal that ressembles that color is shown above the scale.  
    * The 'real' hexadecimal of the color is shown at the middle of the big screen.
